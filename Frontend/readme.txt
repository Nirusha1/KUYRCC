the files here should be arranged in proper places to run properly 
1. the img folder is copied to path where backend.js is placed
2. layout.pug replaced with this one as it contains bootstraps and css urls
3. backend.js and index.html should be modified a bit
4. frontend.pug is copied to views folder of main project
