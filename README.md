Guys if you have already downloaded the .rar file, you dont have to download it again, just downlaod this login.pug and backend.js and then relppace it on your previous file...

input has also been enhanced. so download register.pug

and install bodyParser to enable input in CMD:
>>npm install --save bodyParser
